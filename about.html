        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We are committed to combating medical disorders related to lack of exercise by collecting and redistributing sports equipment to children who cannot afford it. We primarily collect equipment from other schools in the DMV. By providing access to sports gear, we help foster healthier lifestyles and encourage physical activity, enabling kids to improve their well-being through sports. Our goal is to ensure that no child is excluded from the positive impact that physical activity can have on their health and development.</p>
